## Technical Notes for Painting Style

### Emphasize in Prompts:
- "Oil painting" / "oil on canvas"
- "Visible brushstrokes" / "impasto texture"
- "Canvas weave visible"
- "Layered glazing technique"
- "Craquelure" (aged paint cracking)
- "Varnish gleam"
- Reference specific painters: Sargent, Rembrandt, Bouguereau, Winterhalter

### Color Palette (Oil Paint Tones):
```
Velvet Base:     #7A1F2B (Burgundy) / #4A0F15 (Deep Wine)
Shadow Tones:    #2A0A0F (Umber Shadow) / #0D0C0A (Warm Black)
Gold Accents:    #D4AF37 (Primary Gold) / #B8860B (Dark Gold)
Light Rays:      #E6C87E (Warm Highlight) / #F5EDE0 (Ivory Glow)
Canvas Tone:     #CBBCA0 (Aged Linen)
```

### Animation Style:
- Slow, elegant movement (0.5x normal speed feel)
- Subtle "breathing" motion
- Paint texture should shimmer slightly
- Light particles move like painted dots
- Frame rate: 24fps for painterly feel

### Recommended Workflow:
1. **Generate base frame** in Midjourney with `--style raw`
2. **Animate** in Runway Gen-3 with "painterly" style settings
3. **Or** use Pika with "oil painting animation" modifier
4. **Post-process** in After Effects to add canvas texture overlay
